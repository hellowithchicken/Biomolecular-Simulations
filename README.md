## Exploring the Conformational Space of SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein

Final project for course Biomolecular Simulations at the University of Amsterdam.

The project involved performing molecular dynamics and metadynamics with GROMACS on a fragment of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. [Report](https://github.com/hellowithchicken/Biomolecular-Simulations/blob/main/Report.pdf)
