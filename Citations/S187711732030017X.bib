abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulation is a powerful computational technique to study biomolecular systems, which complements experiments by providing insights into the structural dynamics relevant to biological functions at atomic scale. It can also be used to calculate the free energy landscapes of the conformational transitions to better understand the functions of the biomolecules. However, the sampling of biomolecular configurations is limited by the free energy barriers that need to be overcome, leading to considerable gaps between the timescales reached by MD simulation and those governing biological processes. To address this issue, many enhanced sampling methodologies have been developed to increase the sampling efficiency of molecular dynamics simulations and free energy calculations. Usually, enhanced sampling algorithms can be classified into methods based on collective variables (CV-based) and approaches which do not require predefined CVs (CV-free). In this chapter, the theoretical basis of free energy estimation is briefly reviewed first, followed by the reviews of the most common CV-based and CV-free methods including the presentation of some examples and recent developments. Finally, the combination of different enhanced sampling methods is discussed.}
