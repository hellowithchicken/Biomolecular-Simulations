abstract = {In this chapter a number of key techniques are introduced that underpin many of the molecular modeling methods described elsewhere in this volume. The focus will be on those techniques based on the three-dimensional (3D) shapes (or conformations) of molecules, in contrast to the so-called 2D methods that are based solely on the molecular graph (i.e., how the atoms are connected to each other, irrespective of their 3D structures). First, the force field or molecular mechanics method for calculating the energies and other properties of molecular systems is introduced. This provides a way to define the energy hypersurface of a molecule; energy minimization methods are then discussed, which enable the conformations at energy minima to be located. Energy minimization can be coupled with a conformational search algorithm to identify a molecule's minimum energy conformations, including the global minimum energy conformation. Finally, methods for generating 3D alignments for molecules that share some common biological activity are considered.}
